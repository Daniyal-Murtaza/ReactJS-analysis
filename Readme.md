# Generating SonarQube Reports without Premium Version

Generating the report from SonarQube is actually available in the premium version only. However, if you don't want to purchase the premium version, there is an alternative solution that we have discovered through extensive research. By utilizing plugins, you can still generate reports without the need for the premium version.

**Plugin:**

To achieve this, we have successfully utilized the *sonar-cnes-report* plugin version 4.1.3. This plugin provides the necessary functionality to generate reports directly from SonarQube.

**How to Use the Plugin:**

3. Once installed, navigate to the appropriate section within your SonarQube interface to access the plugin's features. This will vary depending on the SonarQube version you are using.

4. Configure the plugin according to your requirements. Refer to the plugin's documentation or the GitHub repository for detailed instructions on how to set up and use the plugin effectively.

5. Utilize the plugin's functionality to generate the desired reports based on your project's code analysis within SonarQube.

**Additional Information:**
